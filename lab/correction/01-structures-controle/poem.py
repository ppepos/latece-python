poem = """O! my Lord in this dark era me you created
bestow me transcendental devotion at your lotus feet,
Nay not I know the Vedic knowledge, nor spiritual masters,
Nor I know the Vedic mores and customs,
O my lord Rao show me the light on my path.

Deliberately or naively I might have done sins,
In my heart they have accumulated like hill,
With your sturdy feet crush it into pieces,
So I can reach thy lotus feet,
O! my Lord Rao show me the light on my path.

In this distressed and wicked materialistic ocean,
The ship of Thy name ,to cross this, I have taken,
Please O! my Lord Rao, never disregard me,
And please lead my ship to reach the other side,
O! my Lord Rao show me the light on my path."""
